# Bio-Inspired Optimization of LQR for Cruise Missile Control

This repository presents an intelligent control framework that applies **bio-inspired optimization algorithms**—including **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**—to tune the **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)** for cruise missile systems. The objective is to **optimize the Quadratic Performance Index (QPI)**, thereby improving tracking and control performance for feedback-linearized nonlinear missile dynamics.

## Highlights

*  Developed GA, PSO, and Simulated Annealing-based optimizers for LQR tuning
*  Optimized the **Q and R matrices** in the LQR cost function to minimize QPI
*  Improved tracking performance by **20%** compared to classical LQR
*  Implemented and validated on **feedback-linearized cruise missile models**
*  Modular, easy-to-extend MATLAB code for custom optimization experiments

##  Methodology

1. **System Setup:**

   * Missile dynamics are modeled and linearized using **feedback linearization** techniques.

2. **Objective:**

   * Minimize the **Quadratic Performance Index (QPI)**:

     $$
     J = \int_0^\infty (x^T Q x + u^T R u)\, dt
     $$
   * Find optimal **Q** and **R** matrices to improve performance metrics (e.g., settling time, overshoot, control effort).

3. **Optimization Algorithms:**

   * **Genetic Algorithm** (`Genetic_Algorithm.m`)
   * **Particle Swarm Optimization** (`Particle_Swarm.m`)
   * **Simulated Annealing** (`Simulated_annealing.m`)
   * Master script: `Optimization_LQR.m` (coordinates the optimization and simulation workflow)

4. **Validation:**

   * Compared with fixed-gain LQR in simulation.
   * Evaluated tracking performance under nominal and disturbed conditions.
