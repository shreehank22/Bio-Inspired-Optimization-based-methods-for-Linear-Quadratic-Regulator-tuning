# Bio-Inspired Optimization-based Methods for Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) Tuning

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of bio-inspired optimization algorithms applied to tune the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for control systems. Traditional LQR tuning relies on manually selecting the weighting matrices $Q$ and $R$, which can be time-consuming and suboptimal. This project automates that process using optimization algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO).

## 📌 Features

* Implements automatic LQR tuning using:

  * **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**
  * **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**
  * **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**
* Provides benchmark comparisons for tuned LQR performance.
* Simulates system responses for step inputs.
* Easy-to-understand and extendable MATLAB code.

## 🧠 Optimization Objective

The goal is to find optimal $Q$ and $R$ matrices such that the closed-loop system:

* Minimizes settling time and overshoot,
* Minimizes the Integral of Time-weighted Absolute Error (ITAE),
* Maximizes control smoothness.
